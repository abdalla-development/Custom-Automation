# Custom-Automation
Portfolio
    • This project scraps the web for the top python projects ideas repeatedly for beginners, intermediate and advance level and pick the names of the top three from each category and their explaining link and send an email to the user as an aspiration or a challenge to test himself.
    • There was no hard part except finding the website that will list the project ideas, while the easy part was formatting the email data and send it.
